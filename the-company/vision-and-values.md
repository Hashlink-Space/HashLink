# Vision and Values

## Our Vision

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Our team has been in the Blockchain ecosystem since 2017. We have served many Gamefi projects, from our view most of projects will have a general problem, because the economic model itself revolves around the community itself and cannot effectively serve the actual economy.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The model will lead to the collapse of the currency price economic model after the user cannot continue to grow once the market changes. We propose the concept of Hashlink, which is backed by a mature demand market, and cooperates with its own token economy and community economy.&#x20;

The currency economy and community economy support the continuous development and update iteration of the product in the early stage, and the product serves the external market and community market, thereby bringing external source income and Burn, etc., and continuously serving the token economy, therefore to achieve a sustainable and effective economic model , provides Healthy cycle.

## Our Goals

The general idea of the project is that the core of any blockchain lies in a brand-new economic model. If all economic models are seperated from actual economic utility and cannot form any interests or correlations in real life, thus they will not be sustainable.

Our projects are mainly Using the fair competition model, mainly serve all e-sports, electronic games, and competitive business fields, so as to continuously introduce profit sources for the entire economic model, and thus support the health and development of the overall token economy. The economy in turn supports the continuous updating and iteration of products, thereby establishing a sound and effective economic model
