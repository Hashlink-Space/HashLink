1. What is the project idea to achieve?
Answer: The general idea of   the project, the core of any blockchain lies in a brand-new economic model. If all economic models are seperated from actual economic utility and cannot form any interests or correlations in real life, thus they will not be sustainable. 

Our projects are mainly Using the fair competition model, mainly serve all e-sports, electronic games, and competitive business fields, so as to continuously introduce profit sources for the entire economic model, and thus support the health and development of the overall token economy. The economy in turn supports the continuous updating and iteration of products, thereby establishing a sound and effective economic model

2. What can be invested and what is the return?
A: Based on Hash, the warrant attribute token of our product HashLink, the monthly benefits of the product are continuously added into Hash at a certain proportion, users invest in Hash, while the price of Hash tokens increases, and Hash NFT (to be launched later) continues to obtain Continuous dividends of product projects, etc. to obtain profit returns

3. What can be used to ensure the stable development of the economy and ecology?
A: The HaskLink product itself has certain partner resources and users. It brings Hash's continuous currency price support through product services, token consumption and other means; in addition, early investors and large investors supervise the development of the overall project through HashDao, so as to improve the effectiveness and orderly development of the overall project;

4. What inspired us to do this project?
A: Our team has been in the Blockchain ecosystem since 2017. We have served many Gamefi projects, from our view most of projects will have a general problem, because the economic model itself revolves around the community itself and cannot effectively serve the actual economy. The model will lead to the collapse of the currency price economic model after the user cannot continue to grow once the market changes. We propose the concept of Hashlink, which is backed by a mature demand market, and cooperates with its own token economy and community economy. The currency economy and community economy support the continuous development and update iteration of the product in the early stage, and the product serves the external market and community market, thereby bringing external source income and Burn, etc., and continuously serving the token economy, therefore to achieve a sustainable and effective economic model , provides Healthy cycle.
